Ducky derby is a racing game where two players can race across the screen.
Player one uses the "F" key and player 2 uses "J".
This game uses javascript to manipulate the margin and padding of images to push them across the screen.
Once a duck has reached the finish side of the screen, the game notifies you of the winning duck and counts the score.
